Web 3.0 has the potential to change the internet as we know it forever. Krypt is a modern real world web 3.0 application connected to the ethereum blockchain that allows users to send ethereum to any address worldwide via MetaMask.

Main Functionalities:
* Users can connect their MetaMask wallets to send ethereum through the blockchain.
* Each transaction will be paired with a gif and it will be forever stored on the blockchain.
* Users can access and view their latest transactions (and the gifs associated with them).
